@chapter Turning your code into a library

In bigger projects it might be useful to put some pieces of code
together and turn it into a library, the obvious case would be to turn
sub projects into libraries.

@section Preparing the Makefile

Take an existing Searduino Makefile. From this you need to add just a
few things:
@*
@*
@itemize @bullet
@item @code{LIB} - set this variable to the name of your library
@item @code{LIB_H} - header files to install
@item @code{USER_LIB_INSTALL_PATH} - where to install your library and headers
@end itemize
@*
@*
After this, the only thing you need to do is to call
@code{lib-install} and your library and headers will be installed.
@*
@i{Note: the library is install under USER_LIB_INSTALL_PATH/lib/board,
where board is the board as derived from the ARDUINO variable}
@*
