@chapter Build for different targets

With Searduino it's (relatively) easy to compile your program for
various boards. You decide what targets to build for with the ARDUINO
variable in the Makefile. The following values of that variable are implemented.

@b{Build types}
@itemize @bullet
@item uno - builds software for the Arduino UNO board
@item mega - builds software for the Arduino Mega board
@item mega2560 - builds software for the Arduino Mega 2560 board
@item due - builds software for the Arduino Mega board
@item stub - builds software for the PC

For now, we would like to refer to pardon in the Searduino source
treee for en example on how to write a simulator in Python.
