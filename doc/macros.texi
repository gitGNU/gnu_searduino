@chapter Various Searduino functions/macros
Searduino provides a small set of macros for you. When building for
your local computer they are enabled, and when building for the
Arduino hw they are disabled.

@multitable  @columnfractions .0 .30 .70
@item 
@tab @b{Macro}
@tab @b{Description}
@item
@tab @code{SEARDUINO_LOOP}
@tab On the Arduino boards this is the same as a for loop
(@code{for(;;)}). When using this macro your code can be paused in the simulator.
@end multitable



@section print functions/macros
@*
If you want to print out strings when building your code for local use (not
on an Arduino board) and have the printouts disabled when building for
Arduino you can use the following macro:
@*
@*
@multitable  @columnfractions .0 .40 .60
@item 
@tab @b{Macro}
@tab @b{Description}
@item 
@tab @code{SEARDUINO_DEBUG((msg))}
@tab The macro (if not building for Arduino boards) takes what is inside
the parenthesies and passes that to printf. It does a bit more than
that, put put simply, that's what it does. 
Example use: @code{SEARDUINO_DEBUG(("The variable x is:%d",x));}
@*
@i{Note: @b{You must use double paranthesises!}}
@end multitable
