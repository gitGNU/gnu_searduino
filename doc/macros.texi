@chapter Various Searduino functions/macros
Searduino provides a small set of macros for you. When building for
your local computer they are enabled, and when building for the
Arduino hw they are disabled.

@tab @b{Description}
@item
@tab @code{SEARDUINO_STUB}
@tab SEARDUINO_STUB is set when compiling for stub (not Arduino boards)
@item
@tab @code{SEARDUINO_ARDUINO}
@tab SEARDUINO_ARDUINO is set when compiling for Arduino boards
@item
@tab @code{SEARDUINO_LOOP}
@tab On the Arduino boards this is the same as a for loop
(@code{for(;;)}). When using this macro your code can be paused in the simulator.
@item 
@tab @code{SEARDUINO_DEBUG((msg))}
@tab The macro (if not building for Arduino boards) takes what is inside
the parenthesies and passes that to printf. It does a bit more than
that, put put simply, that's what it does. 
Example use: @code{SEARDUINO_DEBUG(("The variable x is:%d",x));}
