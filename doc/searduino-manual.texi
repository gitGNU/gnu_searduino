@chapter Build for different targets

With Searduino it's (relatively) easy to compile your program for
various boards. You decide what targets to build for with the ARDUINO
variable in the Makefile. The following values of that variable are implemented.

@b{Build types}
@itemize @bullet
@item uno - builds software for the Arduino UNO board
@item mega - builds software for the Arduino Mega board
@item mega2560 - builds software for the Arduino Mega 2560 board
@item due - builds software for the Arduino Mega board
@item leonardo - builds software for the Arduino Leonardo board
@item stub - builds software for the PC
@end itemize

If your Makefile is actually called Makefile, and not has a
suffix like Makefile.something, you can use special make targets:
@b{Special make targets}
@itemize @bullet
@item make uno - builds software for the Arduino UNO board
@item make mega - builds software for the Arduino Mega board
@item make mega2560 - builds software for the Arduino Mega 2560 board
@item make due - builds software for the Arduino Mega board
@item make leonardo - builds software for the Arduino Leonardo board
@item make stub - builds software for the PC
@item make uno-upload - uploads software to the Arduino UNO board
@item make mega-upload - uploads software to the Arduino Mega board
@item make mega2560-upload - uploads software to the Arduino Mega 2560 board
@item make due-upload - uploads software to the Arduino Mega board
@item make leonardo-upload - uploads software to the Arduino Leonardo board
@item make stub-upload - uploadssoftware to the PC
