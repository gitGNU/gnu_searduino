The authors of Searduino loves developing code for Arduino. We love
using Arduino and we believe that developing code for Arduino has been
made significantly easier for not-so-experienced-developers. However,
for some of us it is easier to develop code in our favorite editors
and build and compile via the command line.

Searduino was initially created to make it possible to automate the
building of your arduino program and to do this outside of the Arduino
IDE. Once we had the compilation and linking up and running we quickly
noticed that it wouldn't take that much to make it possible to turn
your Arduino program into a program executing on your local
computer. The writes and reads on pins in your Arduino program were
'translated' in to reads and writes on stdin/stdout, which we used to
create a simple simulator communicating via a pipe. We saw the
potential of the simulator and decided to write a ``proper'' API for
it instead. To make the simulator more usable for quick checks and for
people preferring GUIs we started to write a simulator GUI in Python,
so we added a Python extension to the simulator API. And here we are
right now....

Hope you like it!
