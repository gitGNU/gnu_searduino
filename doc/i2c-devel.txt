I2C plugins register in the Searduino framework by calling the
i2c_add_device function provided by searduino-i2c.h




int  i2c_add_device (unsigned int device_nr, 
                     const char  *setup_fun);
=================================================================

    Return value: 
    ---------------------
       0 on success
 

    Arguments: 
    ---------------------
    device_nr  - I2C number of the device
    setup_fun  - name of the plugin's setup function which 
                 will be called by Searduino

    Description: 
     --------------------- 

    Each plugin is registered by some unit test code or a simulator,
    using this function. The searduino framework looks for the symbol
    as specified by setup_fun. If found Searduino invokes the
    functions. In this functions the I2C device sets up "what it needs
    to set up".
  

Typically each plugin should register read and write callbacks.
A plugin can be loaded either by a unit test case or by a simulator.
