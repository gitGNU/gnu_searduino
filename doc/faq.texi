@cindex What does undefined reference mean?
@b{What does undefined reference mean?}

In short it means that the linker can't find all the needed ``function
implementation'' for your binary/library. If you're compiling your
Arduino code for local execution it means you're using a function that
has not yet been implemented in Searduino.

You can ask the Searduino folks to do it or you can implement it your
self.
@cindex The code works fine in the simulator but nothing happens on
the Arduino board?

@b{Sim code works, but not on the Arduino?}

One of the thing we've experienced when developing Searduino is that
Arduino crashes when you're having printf and similar calls in your
code. Instead of using printf in your code you can use the debug
macros (e.g SEARDUINO_DEBUG) in Searduino.
