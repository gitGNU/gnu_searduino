@cindex @b{What does undefined reference mean?}

In short it means that the linker can't find all the needed ``function
implementation'' for your binary/library. If you're compiling your
Arduino code for local execution it means you're using a function that
has not yet been implemented in Searduino.

You can ask the Searduino folks to do it or you can implement it your
self.
