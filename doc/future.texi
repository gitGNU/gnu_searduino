It should be possible to add more compiled languages to use to program
the Arduino boards as long as there's a backend compatible with the C
backend of the avr-gcc. It will not (easily t least) be possible to
add byte compiled or interpreted lagnuages, so Java, Perl, Python and
friends are out of the questions. At least for the moment.

Contact us if you want support for your favorite lagnuage.
