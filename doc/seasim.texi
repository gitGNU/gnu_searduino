@subsection Writing a simulator in C/C++ 

Writing a GUI frontend in C/C++ on top of Searduino is pretty straight
forward. We suggest you look into the source code of the streamed
simulator (a command line simulator which is part of Searduino):
@url{http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/searduino.git/tree/simulators/stream}

All functionality offered by Searduino can be found in the header file
called seasim.h:
@url{http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/searduino.git/tree/faked-arduino/include/seasim/seasim.h}


@subsection Writing local tests in Python
For now, we would like to refer to pardon in the Searduino source
treee for en example on how to write a simulator in Python.
