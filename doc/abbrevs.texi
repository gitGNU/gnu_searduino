@item Arduino program - a program written for the Arduino board. Uses only the Arduio and avr APIs.
@item stub - Type of board. When building the software to run locally
on your computer and not building for real Arduino boards we use the
word stub we use this word. A better name would perhaps have been sim or simulaor but
stub it is.
@item Faked Arduino - library implementing the Arduino and avr APIs
@item Streamed input/output - instead of a fullblown simulator GUI
Searduino provides you with a stdin/stdout interface. This can be used
to script (bash, Python..) your test cases. Using programs such as
netcat you can also run the Arduino program on one PC and the test on
another PC.
@item Java interface - All of the simulation features are offered
by a C API s well as via a Java API.
@item local computer - the computer you're developing your code on
@item Jearduino - The grphical simulator, written in Java.
@item Pearduino - The grphical simulator, written in Python/gtk. Obsoleted.
@item Python interface - Most of the simulation features are offered
by a C API s well as via a Python API. This API is deprecated.
