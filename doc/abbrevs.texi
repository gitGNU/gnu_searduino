@item Arduino program - a program that is written for the Arduino board. Uses only the Arduio and avr APIs.
@item Arduino stub - library implementing the Arduino and avr APIs
@item Streamed input/output - instead of a fullblown simulator GUI
Searduino provides you with a stdin/stdout interface. This can be used
to script (bash, Python..) your test cases. Using programs such as
netcat you can also run the Arduino program on one PC and the test on
another PC.
